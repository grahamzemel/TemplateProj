# Template Project
Created by Graham Zemel

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine. Run `git remote rm origin` to remove the remote repository.
2. Go into the api folder and run `git init` to create a new git repository. Then pubish to GitHub.
3. Go into the website folder and run `git init` to create a different repository. Then pubish to GitHub.
4. I like to remain in the TemplateProj root folder to run commands for both the api and website so I can develop them simultaneously.
